Project part 1

Run "make" to compile all code, then run "./Interface" to enter the social network interface. From there, instructions on commands are provided in the readout.

"make clean" will remove all class and binary files

Reading and writing to a text file has not been implemented yet because I have not figured out how to correctly tokenize the input. I will have this functionality for the next part of the project.
