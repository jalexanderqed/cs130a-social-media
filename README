Project part 1

Run "make" to compile all code, then run "./Interface" to enter the social network interface. From there, instructions on commands are provided in the readout.
Run "make clean" to remove all object files.
Persistence data is stored in data.txt


Results of list performance tests (results obtained using "clock()" function):

ArrayList:
n=2000: 0 ms
n=4000: 15 ms
n=6000: 15 ms
n=8000: 46 ms
n=10000: 78 ms

LinkedList:
n=2000: 0 ms
n=4000: 31 ms
n=6000: 78 ms
n=8000: 125 ms
n=10000: 203 ms

Clearly the implementation of List using an array is faster on insert.
